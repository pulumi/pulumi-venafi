-## Import
-
-~>**Note:** This operation doesn't support `issuer_hint` among the attributes for importing, neither local generated certificate key-pair.
-
-~>**Note:** Don't specify an `expiration_window` within your Terraform file when importing, since will trigger a new update on re-applying your configuration unless that's desired. By default we set a value of `168` hours.
-
-The `venafi_certificate` resource supports the Terraform [import](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/import/index.html)
-method.
-
-The `import_id` is composed by an `id` which is different for each platform, a comma (,) and the `key-password`.
-
-The `id` for each platform is:
-
-**TPP:**
-
-The `nickname` of the certificate, which represents the name of the certificate object in TPP. Internally we built the `pickup_id` using the `zone` defined at the provider block.
-
-~>**Note:** The certificate object name at TPP, usually, should be the same as the `common_name` provided as it is considered good practice, but the `nickname` actually could differ from the common name, as there some use cases whenever you want to handle certificates with different nicknames. For example, you could have certificates with same common name and different SANs, then, you could manage many certificate resources that share the same common name using `for_each` and `count` meta arguments.
